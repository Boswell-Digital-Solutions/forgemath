## 9. Backend

### 9.1 Service Responsibilities

| File | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| `app/services/registry_service.py` | create/list/get logic, version sequencing, supersession closure, and determinism-sensitive migration package persistence |
| `app/services/evaluation_service.py` | canonical evaluation persistence, manual-ingest boundary enforcement, canonical artifact hashing, persistence-level active execution exclusivity, trace, replay queue, and incident persistence |
| `app/services/lifecycle_service.py` | replay/stale/recomputation validation, supersession lifecycle control, lineage reads, and cycle/temporal-order hardening |
| `app/services/runtime_admission_service.py` | deterministic runtime validation, runtime certificate derivation, runtime admission inspection, and runtime-recovery posture derivation |
| `app/services/execution_service.py` | bounded canonical execution for the five supported lanes, typed formula and gate-contract validation, and active execution lineage control |
| `app/services/projection_service.py` | governed projection/read-model composition over canonical truth |
| `app/services/immutability.py` | session-level protection against payload mutation |
| `app/lineage/emitter.py` | ForgeLineage producer: emits `forgemath_evaluation` + `forgemath_output` (+ optional `consumed` edge from the upstream eval-cal node) to DataForge-Local |
| `app/lineage/spine_emit.py` | opt-in, non-blocking lineage emission for the Evaluation Spine run; discovers the upstream `eval_cal_record` and drives the emitter |
| `app/models/governance.py` | versioned governance tables |
| `app/models/evaluation.py` | canonical evaluation, lifecycle, and runtime-admission tables |
| `app/database.py` | engine and session factory |

### 9.2 Backend Invariants

- first version must be `1`
- later versions must be sequential
- superseding an active version requires `retired_reason`
- canonical evaluations require frozen input, runtime profile, and full compatibility binding
- canonical evaluations persist explicit deterministic runtime admission truth
- canonical admission fails closed when runtime profile fields are incomplete
- canonical admission fails closed when runtime profile is retired or non-deterministic
- manual ingest may not persist computed canonical truth, caller-supplied output bundles, or caller-supplied output hashes
- canonical execution mode is server-owned on the execution route and may not be caller-supplied
- raw_output_hash is derived from the persisted canonical output/factor/trace artifact bundle for computed strict or degraded truth; blocked hybrid-gate evidence intentionally has no canonical raw-output hash
- trace bundle hashing excludes storage ids so identical reruns preserve stable canonical artifact hashes
- parameter, threshold, and policy bindings must match the evaluation lane when those records declare a lane binding
- optional prior and decay compatibility bindings must resolve when present
- canonical numeric output/factor values persist as deterministic decimal strings rather than floats
- output field names and factor names are unique per evaluation
- output and factor DTOs fail closed when computed rows are semantically incomplete
- bounded execution supports only `verification_burden`, `recurrence_pressure`, `exposure_factor`, and `priority_score` in the `canonical_numeric` lane family, plus `reviewability` in the `hybrid_gate` lane family
- Priority Score admits only bounded `[0,1]` inputs plus a binary control-gap indicator and applies the governed weighted/complemented/subtractive formula using deterministic `Decimal` arithmetic
- Reviewability admits only binary issue flags, computes the governed multiplicative supporting score, and emits a gated posture plus an ordered reason set
- Reviewability hard evidence, lineage, compatibility, replay, or invalid-artifact flags emit `blocked` with audit-readable replay; a degraded-only flag emits `computed_degraded`; no issue flags emit `computed_strict`
- blocked Reviewability evaluations remain append-only audit evidence but do not occupy the unique active canonical execution key
- bounded execution fails closed when variable, parameter, threshold, policy, runtime, or input bindings are missing or inactive
- bounded execution fails closed when supported parameter payloads or threshold topologies violate the bounded execution contract
- bounded execution persists through the existing evaluation service and does not bypass canonical truth tables
- bounded execution emits inspectable factor rows and tier_1_full trace events for supported lanes
- bounded execution fails closed when an active canonical execution already exists for the same execution context unless explicit supersession is declared
- persistence-level unique active canonical execution keys reject duplicate live current-truth inserts for the same governed execution context
- governed canonical supersession may only target prior governed canonical execution lineage records
- repeat execution over the same governed context preserves stable output, factor, trace, and raw-output hashing when lineage supersession is explicit
- projection routes are read-only and derive metadata from canonical compatibility bindings
- projection composition fails closed when source evaluation or source trace truth is missing
- replay posture fails closed when required bindings are missing
- stale posture may not be downgraded or silently reset to fresh
- supersession preserves visibility and records append-only lifecycle events
- lifecycle supersession transitions fail closed when temporal ordering is reversed or a lineage cycle would be created
- only governed lifecycle fields may change after persisted evaluation creation
- canonical runtime profiles reject non-deterministic admission
- runtime-admission inspection derives operator-visible recovery posture and action when the bound runtime profile is degraded
- determinism-sensitive migration packages must declare affected deterministic artifacts and bounded migration posture
- Evaluation Spine lineage emission (`app/lineage/spine_emit.py`, on `evaluate_calibration_report_file`) is **opt-in and non-blocking**: it emits only when `FORGEMATH_LINEAGE_URL` is set, and any emission failure is logged while the evaluation still completes. It emits only ForgeMath's own lineage (`forgemath_evaluation`/`forgemath_output` + a `consumed` edge to the discovered upstream `eval_cal_record`); the `non_recalculation` posture of the output payload is unchanged — no downstream recomputation of upstream authority
- The **`forgemath_output` lineage node payload is identity-only** (the canonical `forgemath_output.v1` schema is `additionalProperties:false`: `output_id`/`lane_evaluation_id`/`payload_hash`/`produced_at`/`schema_version`). The rich evaluation result — **including the `proposal_candidate_allowed` gate** — lives in the output **contract artifact**, referenced from the node via `artifact_ref` (`ArtifactRef.v1`: `artifact_id` = the contract path, `payload_hash` = its sha256). A downstream consumer (ForgeCommand's gate-walk) resolves the gate **from the artifact**, never from the node payload — keeping lineage nodes as pure identity and decisions in artifacts
- arbitrary caller-supplied expressions are never evaluated; supported math remains defined by typed governed contracts and repository code
