### 14.2 Execution

```bash
FORGEMATH_DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./qualification.sqlite3 alembic upgrade head
PYTHONPATH=.ci/forge_lineage/sdk python -m pytest tests -q
python -m app.health_cli
FORGEMATH_DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./qualification.sqlite3 python -m app.health_cli --readiness
bash doc/system/BUILD.sh
bash doc/system/validate_snapshots.sh
git diff --exit-code -- doc/MATSYSTEM.md
```

CI checks out the ForgeLineage SDK at the revision pinned in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` before running the complete suite. Test database
paths use the host temporary directory so the same suite runs on Windows and
POSIX hosts.

### 14.3 Test Boundary

The current suite validates Phase 1 through Phase 7 write logic and invariants.
It also validates the hardening slices for:

- manual-ingest boundary restriction
- derived raw-output hashing
- lane-affinity binding checks
- optional prior/decay compatibility binding enforcement
- computed output/factor payload shape enforcement
- deterministic decimal-string artifact persistence
- active canonical execution conflict handling
- repeatability and hash stability across explicit superseding reruns
- persistence-level active canonical execution uniqueness
- determinism-sensitive migration package metadata rules
- runtime-profile recovery posture derivation on inspection
- supersession temporal-order and cycle protection
- per-factor golden-vector pinning (raw, normalized, weighted values)
- trace summary format stability (_decimal_to_str output for known inputs)
- _clamp_unit saturation at 1.0 when exposure_factor arithmetic exceeds unit ceiling
- exact Priority Score complement, control-gap, subtractive-improvement, clamp, factor, and trace semantics
- Reviewability numeric posture plus strict/degraded/blocked hybrid-gate status, replay, reason-set, and no-hash-on-blocked semantics
- property-generated Priority Score inputs preserve bounds, determinism, and exact factor recomposition
- property-generated Reviewability masks cover all hard-gate/degraded posture combinations and preserve multiplicative-score semantics
- variable registry insufficient coverage rejection (registry present, variables missing)
- stale_input_invalidated positive transition path with input_bundle_invalidated evidence
- stale_upstream_changed positive transition path when upstream registry is superseded
- property-generated decimal serialization round trips without exponent notation
- property-generated formula inputs preserve canonical bounds, determinism, and monotonicity
- property-generated replay postures preserve compatibility and audit-result restrictions
- property-generated lifecycle sequences never reduce stale-state severity
- stateful supersession sequences preserve one active canonical truth and an acyclic append-only lineage chain
- research contracts reject executable/arbitrary-expression claims, unsupported lanes, exponent-form decimals, missing governed artifacts, and unsigned envelopes
- research receipt and signed-package fixtures resolve the same canonical equation-package manifest digest

HTTP route checks and Postgres-backed invariant checks are present but may skip in
restricted environments that block localhost binding or do not provide a Postgres URL.
The Postgres skip is explicit and reproducible: supply
`FORGEMATH_POSTGRES_TEST_URL` to enable it. CI does not silently ignore any
other test failure.

Exact pass counts are qualification evidence, not canonical facts. Reproduce
the current inventory with the complete command above; PRs record the observed
result and environment at review time instead of preserving stale counts here.
